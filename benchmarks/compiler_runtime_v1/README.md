# Shared-runtime compiler backend v1

Status: private next-batch source implementation, NOT admitted or runtime-qualified.
The existing codex-exec campaign, source/proxy validator and labels are unchanged.

`compiler_execution_broker.run_shared_trial(authority, configuration, arm, prompt,
candidate, evidence)` is the explicit opt-in runner entry. `candidate` must be the
fixed qualified workspace root. Both arms bind the same closed configuration:

```json
{
  "backend": "semaprax.shared-runtime-compiler.v1",
  "model": "EXACT_MODEL_FROM_NEW_MATCHED_SPEC",
  "effort": "medium",
  "arms": ["semaprax", "typescript"],
  "runtime_contracts_sha256": {"semaprax": "64_HEX", "typescript": "64_HEX"},
  "runtime_sha256": "64_HEX",
  "compiler_sha256": "64_HEX",
  "compiler_tool_arms": ["semaprax"],
  "allow_model_fallback": false
}
```

The placeholders are illustrative, invalid input. No model or price is chosen
by this example. Separate actual trial-root contracts are explicit; runtime,
compiler, model and effort remain common. The SEM-only codec tool is declared,
not hidden. These two digest slots and fixed_policy establish declared-shape
consistency, not matched effective environment/config/loader proof: HOME,
managed layers and dependency inventories can still differ between contracts.
A future qualifier must bind their common normalized authority fingerprint and
role-equivalent scope before admission; that comparison is not implemented here.
This backend is a new transport/configuration and cannot relabel an
old CLI run, reuse its calibration or claim a current token advantage.

The client requires the exact reserved `ExecutionAuthority` class and calls
`check_current` before launch and EVERY RPC. Static `ProvisioningPlan` values,
caller booleans, hashes and nonces cannot grant admission. The composed authority
module currently refuses ALL admission; no live grant has been manufactured in
tests. Unsupported authority has no old-proxy or unsandboxed fallback.

The runner owns a private stdio app-server connection, with bounded JSON frames,
requests, transcripts, stderr and elapsed waits. It negotiates the exact retained
installed schema, explicitly sets thread/turn/command policy, and refuses unknown
fields or schema-valid authority widening. Policy admits one fixed writable root,
no network, no implicit /tmp or TMPDIR writes; process/socket/loader/effective
policy proof remains a separate required authority obligation.

Compiler requests accept only the existing retained-codec selector grammar.
The runner injects a fresh nonce and invokes the protected compiler ONCE via
`command/exec`, observing the actual connection-scoped response/status/output.
A runner-local completion channel binds the exact Session/authority objects,
request ID, process ID, immutable argv/cwd, contract/runtime/compiler hashes,
compiler path, workspace, environment and declared policy. It loans the live
command object until Session has validated the matching response, then retains
an immutable result and consumes its opaque token once before broker adoption.
Mailbox dictionaries and copied/foreign/replayed tokens cannot replace it;
mutated invocation or authority refuses. This is a Python runner custody boundary,
not protection against arbitrary code executing inside the trusted runner.
The new focused synthetic controls are authored but not executed in this batch;
effective enforcement, immutable executable access and real runtime qualification
remain unavailable, and `ExecutionAuthority.admit` continues to refuse.

Mandatory `capReached` refuses truncation. The stdout stream must contain one
complete <=512-byte publication seal matching the no-follow retained artifact.
The full original v1 structural inventory/derivation kernel is retained separately
from the unchanged proxy-origin adapter; all three inventories remain distinct.
No fake proxy observation is constructed. Semantic replay, authored subtraction,
billing, independent repeat and ratio eligibility are not automatically promoted.

`Session.close` checks settlement only of its runner-owned server process group.
It does not claim that detached child groups were enumerated. Actual per-command
whole-child settlement is an unresolved enforcement-qualification obligation.
Trial result publication happens after server-group settlement.

Eighteen focused transport/broker/protocol controls and four composed static
provisioning controls pass using synthetic metadata, in-memory protocol/process
interfaces and the existing offline receipt fixture. They launch no runtime,
compiler, RPC, model/provider or live benchmark and mint no live grant. Initial
WIP failure/old logs remain in external provenance; the common notification-field
composition defect is repaired. Actual enforcement and runtime qualification are
pending: see [QUALIFICATION.md](QUALIFICATION.md).

The protocol snapshot is a finite reachable-definition projection of the retained
installed schemas. sources.json records all original hashes; Protocol pins the
complete projected bytes. This compatibility evidence does not prove effective
sandbox enforcement. Production campaign CLI selection, fresh token/trace
calibration and hosted/live claims remain outside this private checkpoint.

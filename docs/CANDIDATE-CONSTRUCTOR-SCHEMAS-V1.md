# Candidate Constructor Schemas v1

Status: compiler-owned structural documents with authored, unrun regression
coverage. No semantic acceptance or hosted-validation claim.

Audience: agent builders, compiler contributors, and reviewers.

`SemanticChange::constructor_schemas()` and the candidate-only protocol method
`protocol/constructor-schemas` return
`semaprax.candidate-constructor-schemas.v1`. The transport method requires the
current `image_revision` and existing held-source authentication. It creates no
candidate and changes no registry or filesystem state.

The result carries three JSON Schema draft 2020-12 documents identified by:

- `urn:semaprax.typed-expression.v1`
- `urn:semaprax.semantic-change-intent.v1`
- `urn:semaprax.semantic-change.v1`

Each document is self-contained. Recursive expressions use local `$defs`
references; validators need no network lookup. These IDs resolve the existing
constructor references exposed by Image Candidate Protocol v2 without changing
its previous request descriptors. Every constructor object has explicit
required fields and `additionalProperties: false`.

Expression alternatives cover typed `i64`, `i32`, `u8`, `usize`, and `bool`
literals; places; calls; binary and unary operators; and conditional expressions.
Literal bounds use the corresponding Rust integer limits, including the
target-neutral unsigned 64-bit input range for `usize`; target admission can
still reject a value. New names use the same bounded ordinary identifier shape
and excluded keyword set as candidate constructors. Call arguments recurse into
the same closed expression alternatives.

Intent alternatives cover declaration rename, both append and ordered-mapping
signature forms, whole-body replacement, revision-scoped expression replacement,
and added `requires`/`ensures` contracts. New signature parameters constrain
their `argument` literal kind to match the selected scalar `type`. The complete
change-envelope schema fixes the version and compiler-owned ordered requirement
list. Unknown fields, mixed signature forms, or extra constructor keys are not
part of the described structural grammar.

Constructor limits are drawn from the implementation's shared limit constants.
Depth, aggregate node counts, implicit conditional block nodes, UTF-8 byte
limits, JSON canonicality, duplicate-key rejection, and lexical integer forms
are recorded as extension metadata or nonclaims where standard JSON Schema
alone cannot enforce them. Existing constructor validation remains unchanged;
these schemas do not pre-validate requests or alter legacy diagnostic behavior.

Passing a schema does not establish that a place is in scope, a function is
accessible, a call has the correct arity, an expression has the expected type,
effects are allowed, ownership and cleanup are valid, contracts hold, or the
Project profile/targets admit the resulting source. The actual compiler checks
all those conditions through candidate construction and independent source
replay. `result` is usable as a contract place only in the admitted `ensures`
context. The schema does not certify that contextual rule.

These are constructor documents, not complete response/HIR schemas, installed
SDK packages, source authority, or a behavioral-equivalence proof.

# Owned record scalar field update v1

Audience: language users, compiler contributors and reviewers.

Status: locally qualified for the bounded v1 profile on the interpreter,
native C11 O0/O2 and strict private Core-Wasm.

## Source and admission

`vec_update_field<Row>(rows, index, value, "field") -> Vec<Row>` consumes and
renews an existing owning vector. The selector is last, consistent with lowering
a contiguous left-to-right evaluated operand list followed by literal metadata.
It is one literal ASCII field identifier of at most 256 bytes. It is not a
runtime String, allocation, evaluated fourth operand or dynamic selector.

`Row` is an explicitly identified, monomorphic, invariant-free flat record
already admitted by [Owned Leaf Collections v1](OWNED-LEAF-COLLECTIONS-V1.md):
one through eight explicitly identified fields, one or two direct String/Bytes
leaves, all remaining fields from `i64`, `i32`, `u8`, `usize`, `char`, `f32`,
`f64`, `bool`. The selected field must be one of those Copy scalars, and `value`
must have its exact type; there is no coercion. `index` has type `usize`.
Primitive, Copy-only, nested, recursive, generic, resource, class,
borrowed-field and invariant-bearing records do not acquire this operation.
The legacy two-Bytes record may use its existing carrier when it independently
meets this same predicate; its old operations and physical layout stay exact.

Missing, computed, non-Copy or unsupported selectors/shapes refuse with
`SPX-T320`; ordinary wrong operand types retain `SPX-T205`. An own vector is
required; ordinary move/availability and whole-root loan rules apply. The
operation is allowed in existing bounded loops under their unchanged work and
allocation limits. Loop admission counts four source arguments; lowering removes
only the literal selector, leaving three evaluated runtime children. It creates
no general mutable reference or new authority.

## Evaluation and commit

Evaluate vector, index and value exactly once from left to right. The selector
is resolved statically. Finish RHS evaluation before checking the index; an RHS
failure therefore remains selected even if the index would be out of range.
Authenticate the current owner/generation, complete nominal layout and scalar
slot before storage access. Invalid index selects existing `semaprax.vec.v1`
code 2 before transferring the staged owner. Preflight or RHS failure leaves
staged owners to ordinary canonical failure cleanup.

Success performs one Copy scalar slot store, then publishes the same vector at
its next generation, with one ordinary grouped call commit. Length and capacity
are unchanged. Every unrelated scalar bit and every String/Bytes owner and
payload identity stays unchanged. The store does not clone, allocate, drop a
leaf, rebuild a row, settle another field, call user code or acquire an effect.
Checked preflight generation exhaustion/stale or forged private carriers fail
closed; no stale handle is repaired. Failure selection is sticky and cleanup
plan order is consumed as authored, never sorted or repaired.

A field view protects the whole vector generation through its last use.
Movement/update while that loan is live is refused, including inside a scoped
row traversal. End the loan first; copying an index does not bypass it.
[Scoped Vec Field Reads v1](SCOPED-VEC-FIELD-READS-V1.md) retains its existing
read-only behavior. No view survives mutation.

## HIR, source and cache authority

HIR uses the ordinary owned `Call` form with exactly three runtime children
`.arg.0`, `.arg.1`, `.arg.2`, one exact element type and no function instance.
Its compiler-owned callee is `core.vec.update-field.v1:<descriptor>`. The
canonical length-delimited descriptor retains the exact nominal identity,
complete declaration-order field/type/capacity layout and persistent selected
field ID, bounded to 16384 bytes. Replay independently derives the layout,
field name, type, owner and admission from current declarations. A reserved
prefix alone grants no authority; declarations/imports cannot impersonate it.

The source verifier independently derives the profile from source declarations;
HIR validation checks the exact RHS signature again. Canonical formatting uses
the existing ordinary generic-call grammar and preserves the literal selector.
Graph prelude v19 is selected only by this operation; prior source keeps its
prior prelude schema/bytes. The ordinary graph Call schema is unchanged.
Workspace replay compares the source-derived descriptor at its exact expression
identity. Checked module cache compatibility v12 independently resolves the
retained canonical synthetic source. A coherent same-type field substitution
cannot gain source/cache authority even after rebuilding all ownership proofs.

The existing cleanup, renewal, status and cache Call machinery retains the
operation's fallible preflight/one-owner boundary. No new plan vector is sorted
or repaired. Old public command entry ABI, carrier capacities, profiles v27/v29
and public owning adapters retain their existing admission. Private owned-leaf
profiles alone admit this operation; schema declarations or synthetic origins
cannot widen them.

## Runtime representations

The interpreter uses unique existing vector/record storage and mutates the
selected scalar slot without materializing owned values. Native C11 authenticates
its existing carrier descriptor and index and writes the selected scalar word;
all eight scalar encodings retain exact bits, including signed zero and NaNs.
The success owner transfer follows the ordinary cleanup epoch protocol.

The private Core-Wasm host adds only `spx_vec_update_field_v1`, six i64 arguments
`(handle, nominal_identity, shape, index, ordinal, scalar_bits) -> i64`. Existing
imports, layouts and tags remain unchanged. The operation authenticates the
complete descriptor, current generation, index, ordinal and scalar encoding.
A null failure result consumes nothing; success renews the existing authority
slot once and returns its fresh generation. No row/payload clone, allocation or
Drop occurs at the store. Legacy tag10 descriptor binding is selected only when
this update is reachable. This is a private host protocol, not a public ABI.

## Adoption and owning verification

The actual typed ShiftSim scheduler carries `Worker { id, free_at }` and updates
`free_at` after the assignment's borrowed ID is copied into the output report.
Its runtime parallel worker-state Vec and complete worker-row reconstruction
are removed. `PatientState` and independent sorted arrival indices remain:
they serve different work. Prior WorkerState helper bodies, old scheduler,
independent acceptance/oracles and all original ShiftSim15 tasks stay intact.
The unrelated [inventory example](../examples/inventory-field-update/main.spx)
updates `count` and `active` while preserving `sku` and the other row.

The complete ShiftSim15 corpus passed at the ordinary limits on native C11
O0 and O2. The owning application test ran the retained indexed, wrapper
and unfactored schedulers against the same inputs and expected outputs. The
inventory example returned 42 through the interpreter and native CLI.

All 20 focused checks passed across the library, CLI, `owned_data` and
`cleanup_backends` harnesses. The `field_update` selectors cover canonical
source, graph and cache replay, exact and out-of-bounds indices, all eight
scalar lanes, floating-point bit patterns, RHS failure precedence, stale
generations and malformed carriers. The native and Wasm probes observed
unchanged unrelated owners and scalar bits, zero clone, allocation or drop at
the store, and settlement through final Drop. The interpreter checks cover
vector and row alias refusals and generation overflow before commit. The
independent no-store control pays the same descriptor checks. Scoped production
Clippy passed.

The immediate prior source archives and inverses remain available to the
owning replay checks. Agent tokens, turns, latency and billed cost remain
unmeasured.

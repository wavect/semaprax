# Roadmap

The roadmap follows risk, not feature spectacle. Stable semantic editing, ownership inference, and component boundaries are more important than accumulating syntax.

## 0.1 — Executable semantic seed

Status: implemented in this repository.

- Canonical source and typed expression core.
- Stable declaration identities.
- Revisioned semantic graph and context slices.
- Effects, module permits, and contract guards.
- Machine-readable diagnostics.
- Atomic, stale-safe semantic renames.
- Checked native code generation.

## 0.2 — Useful core language

Status: in progress. Resource ownership boundaries and explicit
lifecycle/interface contracts, lexical `let`, typed `if/else`, partial-place
diagnostics, record syntax/checking, Graph v6, validated stable-ID HIR/type
facts, a mandatory replay-validated cleanup plan, versioned normalized-status
and semantic-event-dictionary types, native scalar status/out execution, a
browser-loadable scalar Wasm backend, and one narrow direct-trivial-resource
Wasm owned ABI are implemented. A private generated-callable native host now
connects the exact loader, authority, ledger, strict codecs, event dictionary,
and compiler-owned trace-path certificate. That host and the real Wasm lane
match the reference outcome, complete trace, publication, and final logical
liveness for all 14 cases at native O0/O2; the remaining public and language
gates below are not.

- Records, variants, `Option`, and `Result`.
- Exhaustive pattern matching.
- Generic functions with constraints.
- Modules, imports, and multi-file graph commits.
- First-class diagnostic repair operations.
- Property tests generated from types and contracts.
- A persistent graph daemon and JSON-RPC agent transport.
- Complete ownership/lifetime/region analysis across control flow.

Exit criterion: build a non-trivial CLI and edit it entirely through semantic transactions.

The aggregate tranche is specified in [RFC
0002](RFC-0002-ALGEBRAIC-DATA.md). RFC 0003 phases 1–2 now supply explicit
trivial/imported lifecycle syntax, declaration-only interface/import contracts,
source/HIR validation, and a target-neutral cleanup plan. Resolved functions
carry typed blocks/edges/regions/exits, guarded liveness, atomic call commits,
sticky status sources, cleanup order, and result publication; validation
independently rebuilds the plan, and Graph v6 serializes it.

Phase 3 now composes its formerly separate native evidence layers for the
private direct-trivial slice. Feature-gated compiler emission produces the
complete generated provider and descriptor v2; compile-time guards prove the C
compiler's architecture/OS/environment/object/endian profile or fail closed.
The host independently authenticates descriptor bytes, strict wire codecs,
dictionary, and the separately fingerprinted compiler trace-path trie-DFA,
then invokes the exact loader-instance callable through the same-thread
authority and atomic ownership ledger. Real generated shared libraries at O0
and O2 match the reference executor for all 14 scenarios, as does real
Node/Wasm.

This proves the narrow private semantics, not the public native boundary.
Compiler resource builds retain `SPX-B104` while physical/malformed-response
fallback cleanup and quiescence remain nongeneralized and Android/iOS device or
static-link profiles are absent. The pinned-nightly Rust-host ASan lane and the
full Linux/macOS/Windows matrix are green in [public run
31259216533](https://github.com/wavect/semaprax/actions/runs/31259216533); the
Rust-host evidence is the narrower [job
93107277065](https://github.com/wavect/semaprax/actions/runs/31259216533/job/93107277065).
The public build-only API/CLI now emits one selected direct-trivial callable-v2
bundle with deterministic hashed metadata, but it exposes no execution,
admission, or adoption surface.
Imported lifecycles, calls, aggregates, broader control flow,
cross-realm/worker identity, aggregate layouts, variants, matching,
concurrency, and fork recovery remain subsequent work.

The model-backed, proposed [RFC 0004 native call recovery and settlement
contract](RFC-0004-NATIVE-CALL-SETTLEMENT.md) specifies the bounded linear
frame, certified checkpoint, idempotent settlement, receipt, and quiescence
model proposed for the physical-failure blocker. The hidden target-neutral model
and private compiler derivation from validated cleanup HIR now exist for the
current direct-trivial owned slice. A private `SPXNPRF1` proof envelope and
independent semantic parser bind that graph to the exact callable-v2 contract;
this deliberately reserves no callable-v3 ABI version and grants no authority.
None of the callable-v3 descriptor, provider, loader admission, host settlement,
physical-finalizer, or public compiler pieces are wired, so this does not advance
phase 3 or `SPX-B104`.

The dedicated Linux
[dynamic-provider sanitizer job](https://github.com/wavect/semaprax/actions/runs/31256134955/job/93099637801)
is green for all 14 O0/O2 generated-provider cases through the host. It linked
the sanitizer runtimes without instrumenting Rust host code; unrelated
Clippy/GCC failures kept the overall workflow run red, so Windows and the full
platform matrix were unproven by that historical run. The later narrow Windows
callable/dependency-isolation run is green; broader application-platform
completion remains open.

The active phase-3 gate is [Owned resource vertical slice
v1](OWNED-RESOURCE-VERTICAL-V1.md). It requires one production-reachable,
thread-confined native host and one instance-confined Wasm host to execute the
same admitted direct-trivial-resource cleanup plan with exact reference-trace
equivalence. The private host now meets that semantic corpus requirement. The
remaining fallback cleanup/quiescence, public execution/admission, and mobile-
profile requirements keep the gate open, and every broader resource or
aggregate shape remains closed. Rust-host ASan instrumentation is green in the
public run cited above.

## 0.3 — Ownership and fast development

- Values, unique ownership, borrowed views, and regions.
- Escape analysis with actionable lifetime diagnostics.
- Explicit shared immutable reference counting.
- Restricted `unsafe` modules and review summaries.
- Cranelift JIT/AOT development backend.

Exit criterion: implement a zero-copy parser and server without a tracing GC.

## 0.4 — Components and packages

- Interface-first package format and target matrices.
- WIT import/export and WebAssembly Component output.
- Portable canonical ABI plus native fast ABI.
- Generated C headers and safe wrapper annotations.
- Capability-sandboxed reproducible package builds.
- Provenance, SBOM, license, and unsafe-code metadata.

Exit criterion: compose SEMAPRAX, Rust, and JavaScript components behind one interface contract.

## 0.5 — Concurrency and applications

- Structured tasks, cancellation, and deterministic scheduling.
- Effect handlers for deterministic tests.
- Application state and semantic UI dialects.
- DOM/CSS server rendering and hydration.
- Platform adapters beginning with web, then Apple and Android.

Exit criterion: ship one offline-first web/mobile validation application with shared logic and native escape hatches.

## 1.0 criteria

- Versioned language, graph, package, and component specifications.
- Reproducible native and component builds on supported targets.
- Stable debugger and profiler integration.
- Audited ownership and unsafe boundaries.
- Compatibility policy and migration tooling.
- At least one production validation system maintained across releases.

# Selected replay recovering constructor v1

Status: source checkpoint; current-head owning execution qualification pending.

Audience: compiler contributors and reviewers.

This internal ownership adapter changes no source admission, graph family,
physical/work ceiling, or authority proof. Source qualification is pending.

`Session::try_from_preparation` borrows the exact existing preparation budget
while reserving the Session header and constructing its one borrowed callee
index, in the existing order. Success moves that budget into Session. Failure
returns the same failed Preparation and the first owned Diagnostic; temporary
index storage has dropped before return. The caller can observe and drop both
without rebuilding the index or restarting either allowance.

The existing `from_preparation` owned-Diagnostic wrapper preserves its prior
already-failed error path. Otherwise it delegates and drops the recovered owner
on refusal. Callee-index structural failures use the selected budget's already
paid refusal String with the same SPX-H006 code and first-report text.

The new test-only zero probe observes sticky state on the same owner. It grants
no authority or credit and does not claim that the unchanged owned-Diagnostic
retry APIs allocate nothing. First-report and recovered-owner Drop remain in
allocation observations; fixed two-member work and exact carrier requests are
independent expectations, rather than receipts reused as formulas.

This does not establish funding for an outward `Vec<Diagnostic>` whose first
carrier reservation fails. The legacy initial Preparation construction error
channel remains owned and unfunded by an outer report carrier. No ordinary scalar lexical authority proposal is applied here.

## Inline initial setup

`Preparation::try_new` now returns either a preparation or an affine failure
containing the exact failed `PhysicalReservation` and a Copy setup reason. It
allocates no Diagnostic, report Vec, or failure text on a refused reservation.
Successful setup preserves the existing reservation order: ledger Box, clone
cursor, then one bounded refusal String. Construction occurs only after those
requests succeed. A later first refusal moves that actual paid String into its
Diagnostic; it does not fund an outward report Vec.

The compatibility `Preparation::new` (now test-only) and
`ReplayBudget::from_reservation` wrappers still convert the inline reason into
an allocating owned Diagnostic.
They are not zero-allocation or caller-funded report boundaries. This neutral
constructor adds no ordinary lexical admission, G410 bypass, new ceiling or
allowance. The caller-owned report that it does not fund is described below.

These controls observe setup and refusal through Drop, with independent literal
carrier requests, zero/one-short setup, first receipt and same text/ledger
pointers. They do not themselves fund an outer report owner.

## Caller-owned paid report (#781, authored, not yet executed)

Status: source-only. Neither the build, Clippy nor the selectors below have
run against this protocol; no allocation fit, performance or benchmark claim
follows from it.

`selected_entry/paid.rs` owns the crate-private protocol types. `ReportForm`
is one fixed outward code and literal message chosen by the actual caller.
`Acquired` is the affine carrier-and-ledger stage: `try_acquire` debits exactly one
`Diagnostic` slot and the form's literal bytes on the caller's selected ledger
before allocating a capacity-one Vec and an exact-capacity String. No function
id or formatted detail is published, so no further text is needed. A refused
debit returns the same rejected ledger and a Copy `SetupReason`
(`ReportCarrier` or `ReportText`) without allocating. `ReportCapacity` is a
post-allocation invariant refusal: the requested layouts were paid, both
buffers are dropped, and their debit stays spent. It is not an allocation-free
initial refusal and does not authorize an unexpected allocator capacity.

`PaidRefusal` is sealed; only `paid.rs` constructs it, so no caller can
present an unpaid or foreign Vec as paid. Its unpaid form retains the failed
ledger and reason. Its paid form retains the published carrier, a Copy
`Refused`, and exactly one ledger owner: the `SetupFailure` from
`Acquired::prepare` (`Preparation::try_new` on the ledger that paid the
carrier), the rejected bare ledger, or the failed `Preparation` recovered from
authentication, a constructor, `Session::try_from_preparation` or a Session
refusal (`Session::into_failed_preparation`, `Session::finish_paid`).
Publication writes into the acquired backing without reallocation. Transfer
marks the preparation failed and rejects its ledger without replacing a first
receipt. Neither form restores work, physical allowance or admission.

### Affine stage pairing

Acquisition returns one `Acquired`, never a `(report, ledger)` pair. Its
`prepare(function)` consumes both and returns the existing `Preparation`
with the carrier held internally. Authentication borrows that combined
preparation; it cannot take the report. `Preparation::into_paid_session`
consumes the entire stage and transfers its carrier with the cumulative
budget into the existing `Session`. Constructor refusal retains that same
combined preparation. `refuse`, `refuse_session`, `refuse_unprepared`, and
`finish_paid` accept no external report, preparation or physical ledger.
Moving a whole stage preserves pairing; no identity token, extra allocation,
new allowance, or report-to-ledger pointer lookup is introduced.

The neutral raw setup constructor is private to `selected_entry`. Only legacy
test constructors produce a preparation/session without a report. Production
cannot construct a detached carrier or split a paid stage; the report's fields
and publication method remain private. The actual local and imported callers
use these consuming transitions, rather than reconstructing a pair at finish.

### Inline refusal on the qualified route

`Refused` is a Copy, heap-free value: a `Cause` (`Mismatch`, `Budget`,
`Constructor`, `Failed`, `Setup`, `Session`), a static detail literal, and the
first static boundary stage. It has no `From` conversion into a `Diagnostic`
or `Vec`. Only the test-only `into_legacy_diagnostic`, and the test-only
`static_text::primitive::legacy` (G410) helper, render it.

The held `Preparation` refuses inline through `try_charge`,
`try_reserve_array`, `try_reserve_vec` and `construct`. A budget refusal from
`ReplayBudget` is the first paid Diagnostic: `budget_refusal` moves the
prepaid refusal text exactly once. The preparation retains it by move as its
`receipt`. A later refusal returns `Refused::FAILED`, or an empty, unallocated
String from a spent budget that is dropped, and never replaces that receipt.
`construct` lends a Copy-refusing debit. Work exhaustion spends the same
prepaid receipt and fails closed, even if a constructor ignores its refused
debit. The selected declaration constructors (`primitive_replay_metered`,
`append_flat_record_replay_metered`, `append_vec_replay_metered`,
`append_scalar_helper_replay_metered`, `helper_signature::admitted`, and the
test-only Option factory) now refuse with `Refused::constructor(literal)`
instead of allocating a `"... reconstruction refused"` Diagnostic.

Every authenticator on the route returns `Result<_, Refused>`:
`primitive::{members, current_module}`, `helpers::{authenticate,
authenticate_target, fact, calls, same_type}`, `helpers::local`,
`helpers::graph`, `helpers::types`, and `records::prepared`. None constructs a
Diagnostic, Vec or String before returning, and the caller transfers the
carrier with `Preparation::refuse(refused)`. The closure boundary
records its stage with `Refused::at` (one static pointer) instead of
formatting test help.

The test-only legacy owners `Preparation::{new, charge, reserve_array,
reserve_vec}` and `Session::{new, from_preparation, finish}` still allocate
`replay_error` on refusal or retry. Production no longer reaches them.

### Session refusal and fixed literal remapping

`Session::try_from_preparation` retains its original Diagnostic contract.
The actual paid callers use `validate_paid` and `validate_scalar_paid`.
Their shared expression-fact producer now has the private typed protocol below;
unmigrated child failures still return the Session's own Diagnostic.
`Preparation::refuse_engine` retains exactly one first receipt, moving an owned
Diagnostic unchanged or retaining typed fact data. Neither is formatted or
published as the outward report. The route stops at the first member refusal.
The paid siblings refuse an already failed Session inline; they never create
the legacy `already failed` retry Diagnostic.

The outward report is a fixed literal remapping. The public `SPX-G410` form,
or the remapping caller's literal, is the carrier's prepaid exact owned text.
The Session text pointer is not transferred into that report. It stays with
the failed ledger owner and is dropped with it when the refusal is published.
`finish_paid` on a failed Session refuses inline with `Refused::FAILED` and
allocates nothing. On success it drops the unused carrier and returns the same
boxed ledger, with no refund or reset.

### Actual caller

The actual caller is `workspace_graph/source_schema/static_text/primitive.rs`
`replay_paid` and its imported `helpers::replay` twin. It creates the module's
ledger, acquires the carrier, then prepares. It transfers the carrier and the
exact failed owner on every later refusal. This contract is on the actual
production route, and no test-only envelope stands in for it.

Typed twins carry the refusal outward without remapping:
`source_schema::schema_with_proofs_paid` and `source_schema::all`, then
`WorkspaceGraphBuild::{into_change_view_paid, into_operation_view_paid,
source_graph_schemas_paid}` in `workspace_graph/paid_view.rs` through
`ViewRefusal`. Remapping callers instead pass the literal they publish:
Change base and candidate (`SPX-G184`), Structural Change (`SPX-G192`) and
Operations (`SPX-G200`) call `into_*_view_reporting(form)`. A paid carrier for
that exact form moves out unchanged, and no replay Vec is formatted after the
refusal.

`PaidRefusal::into_report(expected)` and `into_published` return
`Result<Vec<Diagnostic>, Unpaid>`. Only a paid carrier for exactly `expected`
moves out. An unpaid carrier (`UnpaidReason::Carrier`), a carrier paid for a
different form (`FormMismatch`, dropped and never relabelled) or a non-replay
view refusal (`Legacy`) reaches the Copy `Unpaid` boundary without
allocating. `Unpaid::into_unfunded` is the only operation that then allocates
the requested literal. It is a named compatibility edge, not a funded report.

These compatibility boundaries remain allocating and unfunded, outside the
qualified contract:

- `Unpaid::into_unfunded`, at the view wrappers' outward edge.
- `ViewRefusal::Legacy`: fingerprint and sidecar `SPX-G173`, builder
  structure including `reserve_builder_structure`'s own limit Vec,
  literal-site, helper and schema-selection refusals. A remapping caller drops
  it and publishes its literal through `Unpaid::into_unfunded`.
- The pass-through wrappers `into_change_view` (test-only),
  `into_operation_view` (nominal rename), `source_graph_schemas` (test-only)
  and `source_graph_schemas_receiving` (Semantic Workspace preflight/replay,
  with that preflight's own held sources). These use the public `SPX-G410` form.
  A paid G410 carrier passes through them. An unpaid one is allocated there,
  only through `Unpaid::into_unfunded`.
- Callers above `semantic_workspace` preflight and the Change, Structural
  Change and Operations entry points still return owned `Vec<Diagnostic>`.
  No public type changes in this batch. A v0.10 typed outward refusal would be
  a separate, specified API change.

The qualified imported-helper caller uses `pure_records_checked`: its local
limit is an inline Copy refusal and its charge error moves out unchanged. The
legacy purity wrappers retain their original owned-Vec contract for other
callers. The actual paid acquisition-to-purity-refusal-to-report-to-Drop owner
covers the carrier and ledger together; this removes the classifier's own
refusal allocation, without claiming whole-engine funding.

Remaining concrete gaps inside the route (not claimed as funded):

- Replay engine refusals inside the Session that are not budget refusals
  (`replay_error` in `require_entry`, `selected_callees`, `selected_context`
  and lexical/scalar replay) still allocate their own formatted Diagnostic.
  The route moves that Diagnostic as the receipt and never publishes it, but
  its allocation is unfunded.
- This protocol funds only the outward report carrier and reuses the setup's
  prepaid refusal text as the receipt. It makes no whole-allocation,
  application-fit or authority qualification claim for the replay itself.

Every public literal and code is unchanged. Each selected module ledger now
also carries one report carrier debit (`size_of::<Diagnostic>()` plus the form
length) inside the existing `MAX_CHANGE_BUILDER_BYTES` and the enclosing
active budget. No ceiling is raised. The ordinary lexical proposal stays
unapplied, and no admission, schema or authority is widened.

### Closed scalar lexical receiver (OPT766, authored, not yet executed)

A second actual caller, `workspace_graph/source_schema/scalar_lexical.rs`
`receive_paid`, receives only the separate inventory captured by
`workspace_graph/static_text/scalar_lexical.rs` in both retention routes. It is
a finite profile: a no-import module whose every retained authored function,
contract and dead branch passes the closed census in
`static_text/scalar_lexical/census.rs` (Value scalar signatures, scalar
literals and unprojected places, unary/binary, block, `if`, condition-latched
loops, scalar `let`/assignment and typed exits; `Never` only on an exit and
the block/`if` nodes carrying it), with at least one authored exit. Every
other shape, and every view without receiving sources (Change, Structural
Change, Operations), keeps its existing route and refusal; the frozen
from-parts selectors still produce `SPX-G410`.

Capture is metered on its local work before it reads. After an O(1) shape gate
(which also requires equal authored and resolved function counts), it debits
each member's selector fields, one exact identity key comparison against the
paired resolved function and the census signature. Only then does it reserve
the one census cursor. Each body walk charges its `DEPTH` slot initialization
before the array exists. No `BTreeMap` lookup is performed. Before demand,
exhaustion declines (`None`); it does not fail. A module that is not selected
pays no builder bytes beyond that cursor. If the capture member `Vec` or the
receiver's member census `Vec` is allocated with a capacity other than the one
requested, the allocator's actual excess is charged afterwards to the same
ledger. That charge is never treated as prepaid. Capture then poisons the
active builder budget, and the receiver fails its preparation. Either way the
first refusal stays sticky.

The inventory retains the exact path, module, ordered member identities,
captured identity origins and typed member digests. It retains no source
revision, plan or schema. At reception the Semantic Workspace preflight passes
its own held normalized sources (`ReceivingSources`); the receiver recomputes
the primitive source revision from those bytes and requires every member's
typed digest to replay under it. One existing paid owner then runs exact live
membership, inventory binding, namespace/origin facts, digests, the closed
census, the declaration index, the Session constructor, every member replay
(`validate_paid` for lexical members, `validate_scalar_paid` for the others)
and `finish_paid`, in that order, with one carrier acquired before setup.
Authentication refuses with the Copy `SelectedReplayRefused`.

Only the private consumed `Received` receipt can select this module's Graph
schema. It holds a shared borrow of the exact replayed live module, so `select`
needs only pointer equality and does no per-member work after the ledger is
released. It maps census-derived
flags through `graph::scalar_base_lattice`, the shared ordered v17..v10 tail of
the base classifier; the excluded families' predicates are fixed `false`. A
receipt presented for any other module is the existing unfunded `SPX-G410`
literal. The Session's unmigrated `EngineError::Owned` Diagnostics remain the
open #781 gap above, so this route is not end-to-end funded.

## Typed expression-fact receipt v1 (private, source-only)

This bounded OPT781 tranche is active on the local/imported paid callers but
has not been compiled or executed. It adds no source admission, authority,
physical allowance, work allowance, cache wire change or general engine funding
claim. Legacy lexical replay and test compatibility drivers keep byte-identical
owned errors via an explicit legacy policy.

`expression_facts/errors.rs` defines the private policy. Semantic fact failures
retain a static exact reason, the held body's shared `ExpressionId`, and, for a
duplicate, the exact repeated shared identity. Cloning these existing Arc handles
allocates no identity payload; the immutable source remains borrowed by Session.
These handles are observation data, never lookup permission. They are not a
formatted Diagnostic and do not promise the old inner Diagnostic text on the
new paid API. The fixed outward report is unchanged. The owned compatibility
policy renders the original complete function prefix and duplicate identity,
without truncation, against the saved independent producer/capacity oracle.

Physical fact-cursor, tree, array or clone-backing refusal returns an inline
reason from the physical sub-borrow. After that borrow ends, the original
ReplayBudget consumes its already prepaid text and moves that first Diagnostic
into the same failed Preparation. A single receipt sum prevents semantic data
and a later budget error from replacing one another. No new error identity
allocation, guessed text capacity, quota reset or formatted-error remapping is
introduced. Type work/depth and expression depth remain the original limits;
requires/body/ensures preorder, fact insertion/duplicate timing and all
preclone reservations are unchanged. Capacity and continuation carrier layouts
are still the actual `size_of` layouts at the existing reservation sites.

The paid Arena collector has a separate `ArenaCapacity` owner for its expression
continuations. Its original `FactCapacity` base still owns and funds the complete
514-entry type cursor. The new owner acquires its actual inline layout before
construction and owns one growing expression-frame vector across the function's
requires/body/ensures sequence. No caller supplies spare backing. Every growth
pays complete replacement backing and receiving controls while the previous
allocation is live, and charges every copied or newly initialized slot to the
existing work allowance. Reuse checks the held payer's sticky state, including
an Oracle epoch that has ended. There is no refund, quota increase, lookup
authority, or allocator credit. Both depth ceilings, all payload preclone charges,
fact insertion timing and complete original errors remain unchanged. The legacy
factory and a complete independent fixed-array Arena entry/producer remain
compiled, with full-source byte controls. Deep walks can pay more cumulative
replacement backing than the old fixed array; lower cost is claimed only for
measured shallow owners. Full-HIR and application qualification is pending CI.

The ordinary structural call lookup separately owns a growing stack of lexical
child cursors. Its original 514-slot traversal ceiling is independent of current
backing capacity. The first lookup acquires two slots; later descents acquire
complete replacement buffers up to that same ceiling, charging initialized and
moved slots to the existing work allowance. Requires/body/ensures order, early
lookup return, missing-call diagnostics and downstream signature/transfer checks
are unchanged. Reuse authenticates the existing payer before touching a slot.
The complete fixed-capacity owner remains independently compiled, and byte
controls reconstruct the full previous call module and original lookup body.
Deep traversals can reserve more cumulative bytes; no quota or refund changes.
`structural_control::calls::cursor::tests` owns real-HIR lookup parity, the raw
514/515 boundary, allocator overlap and release, exact/short/zero funding and
work-before-allocation controls. Full-HIR and application qualification remains
pending CI; isolated carrier probes do not establish application fit.

Supplemental receiving has its own independent 1,028-frame ceiling. Its paid
scratch owner acquires two initial frames and keeps that backing across complete
root walks. Deeper pending continuations acquire a full replacement, two vector
controls and a frame control while old backing remains live. Only moved live
frames consume relocation work; unused capacity is never initialized as a
semantic frame. The receiver's dispatch, parameter views, shape derivation,
flag order, callback order and original depth errors remain unchanged. Its
complete fixed-capacity receiver remains independently compiled, with a complete
source inverse and real-HIR callback-parity controls. Deep walks can pay more
cumulative backing than the original eager buffer; application qualification
requires the full owning gates.

Physical reservation wrappers propagate the compiler's caller coordinate to the
existing first-refusal receipt. This preserves all requests, debits, refusal
ordering and messages while identifying the requesting receiver rather than the
shared wrapper. It grants no source or replay authority.

Owning lib controls (authored, unexecuted):

- `cleanup_plan::replay::expression_facts::tests::errors::typed_fact_policy_matches_saved_legacy_text_order_and_full_facts`
- `cleanup_plan::replay::selected_entry::tests::fact_errors::paid_fact_cursor_and_growth_exact_short_keep_first_receipt_and_drop_one_owner`
- `cleanup_plan::replay::selected_entry::tests::fact_errors::paid_fact_semantic_receipt_keeps_exact_shared_ids_and_driver_verdicts`

The affine owner controls observe acquisition, Preparation, Session, the shared
fact producer, receipt/report transfer and Drop in one allocator scope. Source,
enclosing test-ledger setup and fixed observer metadata are excluded explicitly.
Constructor baseline debits are measured separately; the added two-node fact
cursor/tree census is independently literal. Exact/one-short constructor and
later growth, original report/ledger/prepaid text pointers and zero-allocation
retry/publication remain mandatory. Separate success comparisons run the actual
complete lexical and scalar drivers against their legacy verdict/work/backing.
The forged census inputs are not treated as HIR admission or successful replay.

Still open: profile/context/renewal errors, Lookup's structural unknown-ID
errors, inventory/status/structural/path/factored children and their dynamic
Diagnostic producers. The selected test-only borrowed-fact route retains its
existing error contract. This tranche does not establish full transitive
Session funding, ordinary V6 authority, or application fit/performance.


## Ordinary admission and allocation payment

The internal replay budget now separates `AdmissionMode` from
`AllocationPayer`. Ordinary replay remains ordinary when an existing active
builder pays for it. That payer never grants selected type, schema, provider,
renewal or profile authority. Selected reservations already debit the enclosing
builder, so they never receive a second active-builder debit. Legacy standalone
replay outside a bounded builder remains unobserved.

The actual ordinary fact map, slot tree, arbitrary record/variant shape walk,
leaf trees and storage directory reserve their known carrier/backing requests
before construction. Queue/vector growth, clone payment and shared certificate,
path and factored storage guards can consume the active builder. No new limit,
refund or separate ledger is introduced. (Superseded for whole-program
ordinary replay: those same charges now debit a detached per-program replay
scratch ledger; see
[Workspace Semantic Graph](WORKSPACE-SEMANTIC-GRAPH-V1.md#builder-ceiling-and-replay-scratch-ledger).) The original arbitrary-shape algorithm
remains inline; a saved uncharged test oracle preserves its old verdict/order.
The first ordinary refusal String is charged before allocation; initial short
setup returns an inline H006 and retries allocate nothing. Longer current
function IDs acquire replacement refusal backing while the old buffer is held.

Authored controls (not executed):

- `cleanup_plan::replay::allocation::tests::ordinary_builder_payment_never_grants_selected_admission_and_covers_index_drop`
- `cleanup_plan::replay::allocation::tests::active_builder_zero_exact_short_refusal_is_sticky_and_moves_paid_text`

The first control encloses the actual paid indexes and Drop in one allocator
observation, with source, reference indexes, active ledger setup and fixed
observer metadata outside it. The second uses the independent literal request
of one refusal String plus three u64 elements for exact/short/sticky boundaries.
The complete ordinary entry and malformed slot still compare their old verdicts.
The same body checks all three early work-refusal APIs before facts or slots,
including complete legacy first text, and independently prices the ordinary
514-entry clone census cursor for exact/short/reuse boundaries. That cursor is
paid separately from the expression-fact collector's own type cursor.

This is not whole-validator or whole-replay funding evidence. Ordinary schema,
status, transition/exit and observation materialization children still contain
owned constructors, and full HIR validation independently constructs function,
origin, endpoint, scope/type, permit/effect and call indexes. Those remaining
allocations and semantic diagnostic producers require their own actual payment
joins before claiming complete final-validation allocation coverage. Existing
whole-lifecycle owners retain their inequalities and detect the remaining gaps.
No application fit, runtime result, cap increase or ordinary V6 admission is
claimed.

## Retaining typed outward owner (source-only followup)

[Workspace report owner v1](WORKSPACE-REPORT-OWNER-V1.md) adds an affine outward
receiver preserving the exact initial failure or failed Preparation and first
receipt through the typed source-preflight caller. Existing paid carrier
acquisition and physical equations are unchanged. Exact paid publication moves
the original slot/text; initial or mismatched paid publication returns the same
owner. All original legacy publication and Preparation/Session tests remain.
The filesystem view wrappers and full dynamic directory/TLS-help frontier are
explicit legacy residuals, so this followup does not complete OPT781.


## Selected-local static refusal receipts (source-only successor)

The closed local entry, member and profile guards in
`selected_context/paid.rs`, `selected_owner/paid.rs` and
`selected_profile/paid.rs` acquire their actual refusal controls on the current
ReplayBudget before constructing `Atom::SelectedSession`. The acquisition
covers Receipt, EngineError, the Context/function-ID/unit receiving Results
and the retained Option<EngineError>; it performs no diagnostic formatting.
The original guard order and detailed Diagnostic remain the independent legacy
reference. Publication derives its stage from the retained first receipt.

Error-only acquisition does not justify an uncharged increase in successful
receiving layouts. The owning control compares the complete original and current
sum/Option/Result sizes and alignments before that equality can be claimed.
The focused campaign must also exercise the actual public paid-report receiver
from current supported source, including complete Drop and fixed outward fields.
This does not bypass the outer source-graph authenticator to manufacture a
Session refusal. Execution qualification is pending.

Arbitrary renewal and child-helper Diagnostics remain their explicit Owned
boundary. This successor neither funds those producers nor completes whole
transitive OPT781 or application admission; allowances and caps are unchanged.


## Finite selected child refusal cut (source-only successor)

The actual paid Context entry now uses the exact bounded lexical scan and the
selected renewal/helper census/proof twins with closed inline failure data.
Lexical-depth, renewal/helper census and collection-probe failures keep their
original raw H006 rendering; renewal-work and lost-reservation failures keep
the original complete function prefix. No already-allocated Diagnostic is
translated into a paid receipt. Complete old receivers remain compiled, including
the full previous paid Context method, and all diagnostic fields/order remain
owning controls.

Before child entry, the same budget acquires an affine subject-borrowed permit
covering its complete receipt, error, optional and receiving/result controls,
on successful entry too. The typed census/proof receiving and scratch controls
are charged in addition to original backing/node requests; no old-header credit
is taken. Added initializer work is charged explicitly, with all original walk,
lookup and proof units unchanged. The permit owns only the one refusal slot
permission; it lends no lookup, source, member or provider authority. No report
or physical allowance is added. A work failure still zeros remaining before
return; a physical failure keeps the original first ledger receipt. Returning
the exact finite semantic receipt after either failure spends the permit paid
before entry, not a later debit or retroactive diagnostic allocation.

The permit carries the original borrowed subject and consumes itself to retain
the existing shared body identity. It accepts neither a replacement subject nor
a new payer at refusal. Raw detailed rendering remains explicit compatibility;
publication still transfers the original fixed outward report and ledger.
The previous complete sum/Option/Result layout controls remain mandatory: no
portable layout equality, runtime success, byte savings or application recovery
is claimed by this source-only successor. Actual added control bytes/work may
increase cumulative reservations.

Remaining explicit inner boundaries include selected_vector_element's old
ignored classification errors, the selected profile's collection/append and
other dynamic child Diagnostic producers, and arbitrary owned helper/renewal
routes outside this finite cut. They are not certified paid by the new receipt
or the outward report. This batch does not claim whole transitive OPT781 closure.

### Finite paid Context child refusal successor (#781, pending qualification)

The selected paid Context uses closed Copy data for the exact forty-two finite
child labels in its collection, direct-record, row-loan, string-transfer,
literal, latch and owner checks. Their original raw/function-prefixed six-field
diagnostics and first-error order remain the compatibility contract. A borrowed
subject permit acquires complete receiving/error/result/optional controls on the
existing invocation budget before child entry, including successful calls.
The additional Deferred/result controls and their four initializer units are
paid separately from the full eleven permit controls and any nested producer
controls. No old carrier is credited against a new acquisition.

Only real ReplayBudget methods construct the sealed budget-diagnostic arm.
Arbitrary owned child diagnostics cannot be classified as paid through this
seam. Nonselected or absent-owner compatibility wrappers remain explicitly
allocating legacy receivers. Renewal eligibility still ignores failed Vec
classification exactly where the original query did; replacing the discarded
Diagnostic with Copy data grants no new source or payer authority.

The complete former paid Context, profile and owner receivers remain executable
controls, with explicit namespace adapters and immutable whole-source inverses.
This finite adoption does not complete arbitrary later Session/replay/renewal
owned diagnostic propagation. Those residuals, unsupported admission profiles,
and outward legacy rendering remain explicit; issue #781 is not closed by the
source-only successor or by observing its tests before qualification.

## Duplicated driver-local receiving cut (#781, source-only)

The actual paid lexical and scalar driver bodies call the existing paid profile
and member-owner twins at their original positions. Their complete generic
Diagnostic-policy bodies remain independent legacy references. Specializing the
paid bodies removes the previous fact-builder callback/forwarding arguments; no
new helper Result, aggregate allowance, cap change or old-header credit is added.
The paid twins retain their actual receiving permits and initializer work, so
this repeated validation can reserve more cumulative controls than the former
legacy calls. No savings or admission claim follows.

The direct receiving owner compares both complete old driver entries with
profile and identity-by-address failures, checks all six legacy diagnostic fields
through the explicit renderer, and transfers the actual prepaid semantic receipt
into the same report/ledger owner through sticky rejection and complete Drop.
These are internal hostile receiving controls, not a bypass of public source
authentication. Source-only qualification is pending. Initial report acquisition,
inline zero/short setup, fixed outward publication and named unfunded legacy
boundaries are unchanged.

This is not transitive Session funding. Lexical-exit validation, structure bounds,
inventory/status construction, region/entry/exit/certificate/CFG validation, path
replay, factored comparison, and the scalar signature/body/schema/trace families
still include Diagnostic-returning children converted to EngineError::Owned.
Budget failures also retain their genuinely prepaid original Diagnostic. An
already-owned semantic Diagnostic is not retroactively paid by report transfer;
#781 remains open.

## Reference-coverage receiving cut (#781, source-only)

Paid lexical and scalar Session drivers use the complete reference-coverage
algorithm with closed edge-owner, exit-owner and status-declaration refusals.
The original Diagnostic producer remains independent. The two actual vector
wrapper calls each acquire a nine-slot receiving bank and nine initializer work
units on the same ledger before their arguments. Each genuinely new status-set
node separately acquires its eight-slot bank and eight units before its wrapper;
duplicates acquire neither. There is no guessed per-function loop allowance.
The existing profile permit covers entry/refusal composition. BudgetDiagnostic
remains sealed: only genuine ReplayBudget producers construct that arm.

The original status membership and traversal order, then edge/exit/status error
priority, stay exact. New receiving reservations and initializer work may refuse
before the former backing or semantic frontier; no old allowance is credited.
The node helper forwarding Result is eliminated lexically; the two real budget
wrapper Results and their Diagnostic/Deferred receivers remain explicitly paid.
Initial report acquisition, report carrier, inline refusal and all legacy
wrappers stay unchanged. This finite family and the prior profile/owner tranche
do not complete the remaining dynamic Session validator families: #781 stays
open. Focused semantic, exact/short/zero, duplicate, ledger and Drop controls are
authored; no execution or savings claim follows from this source checkpoint.

## Structural leaf-family receiving cut (#781, source-only)

Paid lexical and scalar drivers use complete slot, region and leaf algorithms
with closed static labels and the existing shared-identity dynamic atoms. The
attached flat-record leaf collector and storage-index constructor preserve all
membership, insertion, field, flag and error ordering. Every actual clone and
vector forwarding call acquires its nine/ten-slot receiving layout on the SAME
budget before arguments; conditional nodes retain their eight-slot bank only
when the original membership test admits insertion. The lexical expansion adds
no extra forwarding function or Result. Original nested budget Results remain.
Each helper acquires its existing profile permit for its actual return type;
slot dynamic Atom initialization/receiving has a separate two-Atom bank.

These payments and initializer work are genuine earlier refusal frontiers, not
old-fee credit or a refund. Genuine budget errors alone use sealed
BudgetDiagnostic; static and shared-identity semantic failures remain closed
receipts for the already-funded report. Compatibility Diagnostic renderers and
full immediate-old drivers remain independent. The initial receiving boundary
retains the existing report/ledger contract; no arbitrary child Diagnostic is
certified after construction. The inventory builder still returns an owned
Diagnostic through its raw physical callback; status, certificate, path and
other unmigrated families remain residual, so #781 stays OPEN. No runtime,
allocation reduction, application-fit or end-to-end funding claim follows.

## Status and scalar-local receiving cut (#781, source-only)

Paid lexical/scalar drivers use complete status reconstruction with seven closed
labels and one shared-identity unknown-callee atom. Requires, body, ensures,
ordinal conversion, case normalization and all vector/clone ordering remain.
Each actual twelve-site array/Vec/clone call acquires the existing exact
same-ledger receiving layout before arguments. The dynamic Atom initializer and
receiving pair is paid only when the unchanged callee lookup actually fails,
before its identity clone or receipt construction. Successful collectors do
not acquire that error-only bank. The original complete producer is unchanged.

Selected scalar record/body checks retain the full signature, rooted parameter,
projected field, mode/type and cursor algorithms. The original pure type-key
math is lexical, removing extra helper Results rather than introducing nested
mutable-budget forwarding. Error Option conversions are lexical returning
branches so the affine permit survives successful iterations. Each actual
new helper Result/receipt bank is acquired for its return type before entry.
The generic borrowed-scalar helper remains unchanged and has only its original
real ReplayBudget charge callback; its new outer Error mapping is prepaid and
cannot convert an arbitrary semantic Diagnostic. Existing typed inline record
classification and its exact original refusal labels remain source-bound.

Complete immediate-prior paid drivers, original scalar traversal and record
helpers remain independently executable. Four owning controls cover complete
status/static/dynamic diagnostics, actual exact/short/work/Drop, full record
shape answers, and source-authenticated whole old/current drivers. They are
unexecuted source gates. New entry/control payments may refuse before an old
semantic or backing frontier; old fees, forecasts and caps are unchanged.

This cut does not establish transitive #781 funding. Inventory-builder raw
callbacks, lexical certificates, scalar schema/borrowed-test adapters, CFG,
path and factored descendants still include original owned Diagnostics.
Those genuine boundaries require separate typed cuts; no late relabeling or
whole-Session closure is claimed. Ordinary and legacy paths remain allocating.

## Certificate receiving and dead Deferred slots (#781, source-only)

The selected lexical certificate entry and its dictionary/DFS children acquire
the existing per-call same-ledger receiving banks before real array, clone,
Vec or conditional node arguments. Fifty-two static semantic failures carry
closed certificate data. Original traversal, branch order, normal-end checks,
work and error text remain; original certificate and complete immediate-prior
paid drivers remain independently executable. Borrowed chain, type/drop and
lexical-boundary children still forward their original owned Diagnostics and
are explicit residuals. No arbitrary Diagnostic is certified after creation.

Five scalar-record helpers, the scalar driver entry and the borrowed-scalar
bool receiver use the existing acquire bank: their own scopes never construct
or resolve Deferred, including genuine old budget-error forwarding. Real
child Deferred producers retain their own profile banks. This removes exactly
the dead four-slot profile tuple and its initializer work, without a refund or
new protocol. Initial receiving payments remain genuine earlier refusal
frontiers. Four unexecuted owners cover full certificate fields/hostile order,
actual bill/work/exact-short-zero/Drop, complete old/current drivers and exact
read-only slot removal. #781 remains OPEN for unmigrated descendants; there is
no measured saving, application-fit or closure claim.

## Boundary admission and selected region chains (#781, source-only)

The selected certificate calls a complete boundary-admission twin. Its original
FnMut admission callback is expanded lexically at the same ordered call sites,
so no new forwarding Result or closure captures a successful affine permit.
Ten boundary/chain failures carry exact closed text; real dictionary nodes and
region-chain arrays use the existing per-call same-ledger primitive receiving.
The original borrowed chain query stays an explicit owned-error residual;
its boolean parameter is not replaced by a new mutable-budget forwarding ABI. Admission payments precede new
receivers and may refuse earlier than old semantic/backing failures.

One original chain query is intentionally consumed by a boolean any predicate
with unwrap_or(false). It remains on the complete original query; routing a new
paid refusal into that swallow would be unsound. Type/drop, scalar schema, raw
inventory, path-state boundary checking and other unmigrated children remain
owned-Diagnostic residuals. No complete #781 funding/closure is claimed. Four
unexecuted owners compare complete Auth fields and hostile order, physical
exact/short/work/Drop, full prior/current paid drivers, and chain order/cycle/
unknown diagnostics. Immediate-prior certificate/storage/driver receivers are
independent, with complete source custody. No savings or fit is measured.

## Lexical selected type/drop receiving (#781, source-only)

The certificate's existing live affine permit now encloses the complete selected
type/drop query: Never, Option<u8> authentication, exact current Vec declaration,
bounded element and flat-record declaration/field scans, and primitive fallback.
The original public/inline classifiers stay independent. Their exact parameter
receiving references become lexical locals, and returned bool/borrowed Option
values become block values; nested query Result/formatter forwarding disappears.
No new caller mutable-budget argument, receiving bank, allowance or fee credit
is introduced. Every semantic failure consumes the already-paid permit only on
a returning error branch; success retains it for the remaining certificate.

Two raw cleanup labels use closed TypeDrop data; existing Profile labels retain
their exact raw/prefixed renderer classification. Original cfg(test) oracle
authentication and its old account budget/error paths execute first, unchanged.
The full ordinary type-fact query and dynamic identity diagnostic remain the
original owning fallback. No serialized type key is reinterpreted or trusted.

Four unexecuted owners retain complete prior certificate/storage algorithms,
compare full Auth fields and hostile metadata, compare 34 actual/forged type
forms and all six diagnostic fields, and observe whole paid Context/query/Drop
with actual bills/work and exact/short/zero controls. They make no universal
allocation, saving or application-fit assertion. Schema/inventory callbacks,
path-state boundaries, borrowed chain diagnostics and other descendants remain
explicit owned-Diagnostic residuals, so #781 remains OPEN.

Macro receiving preserves the original explicit trait-object and type-reference
parameter shapes. The flat-field block returns a borrowed slice via as_slice,
corresponding to the old implicit Vec-to-slice return coercion; it does not
introduce a thin &Vec view or new iterator forwarding.

## Direct path boundary and borrowed chain receiving (#781, source-only)

The existing eight path-boundary inputs enter one direct error-policy body. Diagnostic keeps the complete original algorithm. Engine retains its ordinary unobserved fallback; on a paying invocation it acquires the existing actual `Permit::acquire<()>` bank before boundary lookup/failure formation, and the complete finalizer body acquires its own bank. Each new unique finalized flag uses the existing per-actual-call profile/node primitive on the same ReplayBudget. No Diagnostic is relabelled as paid provenance. Full storage/leaf/return/contour/error order survives, including the original selected conditional-profile refusal.

These new per-call bank payments can legitimately refuse before old semantic lookup or scratch insertion and consume work before later refusal. They grant no retry, refund, donor authority, new cap or old mixed-resource first-winner guarantee. Ordinary Diagnostic policy and complete immediate-old path replay remain executable independently. Borrowed rejecting chain macros consume the existing caller permit, preserve checked-sub-before-region-get and all lazy surrounding predicates. The separate or-false macro keeps the original intentional error suppression with no added debit; ordinary query fallback stays unchanged.

The initial bank failure remains the existing unreceived ABI boundary. All new static paths preserve complete six-field diagnostic rendering through the existing funded report. Raw inventory callbacks, schema/checked-binding children, ordinary dynamic type facts and other unmigrated descendants remain owning boundaries. #781 remains open and this source checkpoint makes no executable or cost claim.


### Synchronous typed raw-inventory boundary

The selected flat-record inventory twin accepts the existing physical reservation and remaining-work fields borrowed synchronously from the caller's actual ReplayBudget. It creates no allowance, retained payer, callback authority, or source verdict. InventoryFailure is opaque: work originates only at actual checked subtraction, physical/receiving failures only at actual reservations, and finite classifier failures only at their closed primitive branches. Arbitrary Diagnostics cannot be converted into it. Original public-private Diagnostic builder/callback entrypoints and their complete checker remain independently executable.

Before the new Builder, Ledger, RefCell, Vec headers and inventory outputs are formed, an actual-layout initial bank is debited; each method admits its actual compact result/failure and added ledger-borrow controls before subsequent producers. Initial metadata acquisition itself is an explicit unreceived ABI on failure, including the bank's own primitive borrow/result path; no failed debit retroactively funds it. Successful metadata and initializer work remain spent. Original traversal/probe/clone work and parameter/requires/body/result/ensures order remain unchanged and are separately observed. No donor, retry, refund, cap change, or reservation estimate grants authority. The raw API retains no owner between calls, so its explicit borrowed ledger is not represented as a retained foreign-owner capability.

The paid coverage caller uses the existing affine selected-child permit for actual raw failures. Its remaining inventory comparisons and supplemental/schema checker are still ordinary owning diagnostics, explicitly outside this tranche. Same-format publication uses the existing receipt/Diagnostic bridges; this boundary does not reinterpret a returned Diagnostic. New metadata frontiers can select an earlier refusal and increase common costs. Exact mixed-resource first-winner equality and application-fit gains are not claimed from source; focused owners must report the real tradeoff.

## Raw inventory initial receiving (#781, source-only)

The selected lexical/scalar coverage caller now admits the complete raw
`Result<CleanupInventory, InventoryFailure>` boundary before forming its four
arguments. A dedicated lexical expansion calls the existing authenticated
`ReplayBudget::reserve_bytes` on the same retained physical reservation, then
calls the existing checked/zeroing typed debit on that budget's remaining field.
The debit is irreversible, not a temporary grant: no scope exit refunds it.
There is no additional preflight function, callback or forwarding Result.
The physical acquiring primitive retains its existing paid Diagnostic/inline
initial-refusal contract; no failed raw self-payment is credited retroactively.

After admission, the shipping constructor starts at the original builder body.
Its former initial reserve and work self-payment are absent. The exact raw
receiving inventory has44 fields: the prior42 minus the removed primitive
physical Result pair and byte-argument pair, plus the program/function argument
and parameter pairs and the debit remaining reborrow/parameter pair. Complete
Kind/InventoryFailure layouts pay their actual maximum alternative; no arbitrary
Diagnostic can enter those sealed constructors. Existing per-method acquisition
boundaries, schema/supplemental diagnostics and other #781 residuals remain open.

The complete60ad typed entry and initial layout remain independent cfg(test)
controls, as do the original Diagnostic builder/callback and full coverage
checker. New owners assert whole inventory/six-field mismatch parity, actual raw
entry and retained ledger/remaining pointers, irreversible charge across result
conversion/Drop, exact/one-short/zero physical frontiers, work zero/short/exact,
floors and first refusal. They are authored only; no Rust execution, numerical
benefit, application admission or #781 closure is claimed.

### Selected schema and inventory family candidate (#781)

The next isolated source candidate extends the existing paid Session path at
`scalar_replay::validate_paid` and `inventory_coverage::paid`. It is not runtime
qualification or closure of #781. The original general APIs remain available,
and the complete pre-batch paid inventory and scalar owners are compiled only
as independent controls in their existing owning harnesses.

The scalar receiver preserves profile and owner validation before schema
selection. Its order is the original local helper-potential predicate and helper
census, lexical selection, complete inventory summary, record destructure/update
classification, then owner admission and the original schema choices. Imported
helper directory membership does not enlarge the original local potential
predicate. The summary uses the existing same-payer type-fact constructors;
their already funded dynamic Strings move into their original diagnostics. A
Diagnostic-shaped result alone is not evidence of an unpaid allocation.

The always-run update expression scan now pays its pending Vec header, actual
root/child growth and receiving controls before formation. Complete selected
profile validation already refuses every UpdateRecord before this scan. The
original general update authenticator and its generic descendants are preserved;
this selected call does not add admission to those excluded shapes.

Selected inventory comparison and the exact selected supplemental walk retain
the original raw typed inventory constructor, requires/body/ensures order,
1028-frame bound, parameter lookup order, probe prepayment, type/drop queries,
flat shapes and all original payload debits. Finite refusals retain a closed
`selected_context::family::Reason`; base and supplemental slot indices remain
actual usize operands. The receipt retains the exact shared body identity.
Detailed text is rendered only by the explicit legacy observation, after the
paid route. Report publication consumes the caller's same preacquired carrier
and same affine ledger; no new report vector, text or ownership permission is
created by the receipt.

Every new receiving declaration uses its actual Rust type in `size_of` through
`reserve_array`, including helper results, Reason/Atom/Receipt/Error transport,
shape and supplemental receiving frames, query activation fields and closed
metadata match results/bindings. The new family layer pays
`size_of::<FamilyReceiving>()` and nine field initializer/transfer units, then
retains the existing full `Permit::acquire<T>` debit and eleven units. It takes
no old-header credit. A separate lexical `FamilyCallReceiving` tuple pays the
function/budget arguments and returned Permit/Error before every family call,
and again before the new family wrapper calls the existing acquire method;
these are two real caller boundaries, each with three field units. Thus the
complete new family invocation retains all existing callee charges and adds
both caller frontiers rather than funding arguments after they already exist.
Per-query activation tuples and each actual closed query
match have separate debits; fixed cursor backing and original lifecycle/type/
identity charges remain. An old/new bill comparison must include every reached
family activation, helper proof/census and summary/update allocation, all
transport layouts, active floor refusal and complete Drop. No byte, work or
performance result is asserted from source alone.

The owning new selectors are:

- `inventory_coverage::typed_tests::selected_family` (complete old success,
  hostile base/entry/supplemental six-field diagnostics, receiving floors/work,
  same ledger and full Drop).
- `scalar_replay::selected_family_tests` (complete original schema and scalar
  owner, owned local/call argument storage, schema/loan first refusal).
- `selected_entry::tests::paid::selected_family` (a real inventory child refusal,
  original carrier/text/source/ledger pointers, first sticky receipt, later
  receipt non-replacement, allocation-free publication and full Drop).

Existing raw inventory, typed-child, profile, report, authority and source
identity controls retain their assertions. Source-custody inverses must include
new module registrations and joined production children without reducing the
whole original authenticated subjects. These tests are selected but unrun in
this source-only lane.

This family is not a claim that all paid Session descendants are migrated.
Later lexical HIR validation, path-state and factored comparison descendants
still include original semantic Diagnostic producers. They remain explicit
unpaid production residuals, rather than being reclassified as allocating
legacy compatibility. The outward named Legacy APIs retain their existing,
separate compatibility classification.


### Selected structural-control receiving candidate (#781, unqualified)

The next source-only batch extends the admitted paid scalar and lexical
Session family through status metadata, entry places, block/edge/terminator
validation, exact call transfer children, staged Copy target checks, selected
same-owner renewal binding, ordered finalizers, exit-region chains and CFG.
The original general APIs remain complete. Test-only immediate pre-control
scalar and lexical drivers retain every original child route; they never call
the new selected structural twin. No admission profile, quota, tariff or cap
changes, and no source or proof authority is added.

Each new child has a typed lexical caller argument/result admission before the
call forms its arguments, followed by its separate actual callee roles. Finite
semantic refusals carry a closed reason; unknown expression/status operands
retain shared immutable identities, with rendering only at named legacy
observation. The twelve-field control bank separately pays the dynamic clone
receiver/result, terminal body-ID clone receiver/result, two moved Reason roles,
Permit/function arguments, Atom, Receipt, Error and permit Result. The retained
old eleven-field acquire bank is unchanged. Full permit work is
`3 + 12 + 3 + 11 = 29`, before actual local/caller and original operation work.
All physical layouts use actual Rust types, including ID layouts, padding,
Results, Option, iterators, cursor and owned headers; no old-fee credit is used.

Finite-error option closures have an additional lexical capture/typed-Result
debit before closure formation, on every reached formation, independent of the
terminal receipt bank. Control and call option closures each add two actual
roles/work units; call integer-conversion closures add three; the control index
closure additionally carries its borrowed Kind and adds four. The CFG successor
map/transpose is an explicit match with five typed transport roles, preserving
successor lookup order. These costs are included even when the option succeeds;
no pre-existing closure or error header is subtracted as credit.

Pure signature queries expand inline with typed match/query roles, including
actual double-reference pattern bindings. Their explicit Some matches preserve
parameter lookup before ownership classification and avoid adding closure
captures. Original cursor/backing/tree/vector/type/probe payments remain. The
scalar empty return-operand set is separately present in its caller frame;
test-only optional borrowed scratch carriers and the borrowed status formal
also have their own actual typed roles. These additions are costs, not a source
claim of byte, work, fit or performance improvement.

The existing owning harnesses add selectors under
`structural_control::selected::tests` and
`selected_entry::tests::paid::selected_control`. Controls compare all six
Diagnostic fields and original first refusal against complete immediate-old
owners; ordinary whole replay remains an independent control. Genuine held
primitive and retained nominal fixtures cover success, unknown entry,
profile/schema precedence, block/edge/branch/exit corruption, call transfers,
dynamic IDs, renewal, staged targets, finalizers and CFG. Exact/one-short and
zero work controls derive the entry floor from independent literal typed frames;
there the added work is `5 + 9 + 3 + 12 + 3 + 11 = 43`. Real Session refusal
checks original report/text/source/ledger pointers, sticky first error,
allocation-free publication and complete Drop. These controls are authored but
unrun; the candidate has not been built or runtime qualified.

This is still not complete #781 closure. The selected lexical route next calls
`lexical_hir::collect` and existing lexical-certificate descendants; both selected
routes subsequently call path-state/transition and factored comparisons. Their
remaining internal semantic Diagnostic producers are explicit unpaid production
residuals, not newly invented legacy exclusions. A whole scalar duplicate-live
Initialize witness is authored to isolate the existing path transition boundary
after this family; it remains unverified until owning runtime qualification.
External named allocating compatibility APIs retain their original scope.

### Selected path-state, transitions and renewal receiving candidate (#781)

The next isolated source candidate routes only the paid selected scalar and
lexical drivers through `path_join::selected`. Ordinary replay and the complete
immediate pre-path scalar/lexical drivers remain independently compiled. The
selected twin keeps original path scheduling, left-to-right transition order,
first refusal, exact old join/clone/materialization work and cleanup ordering.
The genuine duplicate-live Initialize witness now retains finite typed failure
data through the existing Control12 permit and prepaid Session report.

A nested `ControlReason::Path` carries only a finite reason or the original
block/exit number. It grants no source, identity, report or replay authority.
Caller and callee arguments/results are admitted before formation on the same
ledger. The original dynamic call/status atoms retain their original renderer
and stage. Complete original Reason/Atom/Receipt/EngineError shapes are compiled
as a layout witness; no-growth assertions are authored but unrun. Shipping
`size_of` requests always charge the actual current carriers. No current enum
is used as the purported original footprint.

Every reached explicit next/get/index/remove result has its literal typed
receiving packet before evaluation, including reached terminal None. Concrete
iterator/frame headers retain their separate entry charges. Lexical scan,
filter, equality and stable Copy-flag compaction macros form no hidden closure
or forwarding helper. Reverse-stack renewal expression lookup retains original
reverse root/child search order and admits actual Vec backing before growth.
The original lookup and renewal APIs remain unchanged. Selected renewal work
calculation uses the same paid traversal and exact old materialization units;
its repeated old discovery is not silently cached or credited away.

Selected renewal provenance construction/stage/commit use explicit paid loops.
Their private storage borrow/construction accessors grant no authority and have
literal caller/callee receiving banks. Original `RenewalHistory` methods remain
independent controls. Same-owner String append keeps ordered first-match lookup
and original publication/history order. Neither path order nor canonical cleanup
vectors are sorted or repaired. Actual payload backing stays separately funded.

Earlier closed source/profile/structural validation excludes affine closure
calls, conditional aggregate ownership and ordinary-only staged Copy branches
before this selected family. Those facts do not admit malformed raw general
APIs. The original general descendants and whole pre-path drivers remain the
controls. No arbitrary legacy API is reclassified as funded. Later factored
comparison descendants and any earlier unmigrated paid-Session family remain
explicit production residuals; this candidate does not close #781.

The owning `path_join::selected::tests` children author whole ordinary/pre-path/
current success and hostile comparisons over all six diagnostic fields; genuine
nominal, byte renewal and String append fixtures; exact/one-short/zero/work/
sticky/source-pointer controls; complete original carrier layouts; literal
known/unknown reverse-stack lookup floors; reached terminal None; provenance
zero/one/many cases; paid current Session report-pointer retention and full Drop.
Original structural/schema controls continue to target current drivers.

This source-only candidate has not been built or run. New receiving/frame/
lookup/control costs are additive; no cap, old tariff, allowance or limit is
lowered or raised. No net application gain, executable gate, #781 closure or
improvement to the earlier 64MiB HIR-final refusals is claimed. Source custody
and physical-role inventory coupling are deferred to the owning integration
lane after sealing and independent review.


The source-only #781 review successor retains the original finite-family9 and
control12 packets and all original child charges. Current family adds the actual
terminal source-clone reference as a separate one-role invoice (family9+1); every new family/control wrapper
call additionally admits its own actual formal3 tuple at the lexical caller,
separately from the original actual3 tuple, before invocation. Complete wrapper
work is therefore family30 and control32. The complete old methods and original
26/43/46/50 generation controls remain compiled, with current floor/short/zero/
work/sticky/Drop counterparts. No old header or payload is credited back.
The selected owner-admission helper retains one514-element array across roots;
completed roots drain every reached slot with `take`. Its own formal4 tuple is
admitted at its caller. Each actual counted pop admits a fresh six-role packet
before `take`, without inventing a terminal probe. Additional work is4 per helper
activation plus6 per reached pop; physical cost is the full actual formal tuple
plus one full pop tuple per reached pop. The forest-count control uses2N−R for
complete pure Copy traversals, not a successful-prefix estimate on refusal.
New finite permit-error callbacks use direct lexical matches instead of fresh
capturing closures. All old public APIs, complete immediate controls, first-error
order and quotas remain. These source definitions are unrun and make no fit or
performance claim; current cold receiving costs increase until actual composed
qualification establishes the complete outcome.

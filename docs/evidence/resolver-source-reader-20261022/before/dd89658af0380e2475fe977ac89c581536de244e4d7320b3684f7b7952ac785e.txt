//! Immutable borrowed `Slice<u8>` traversal over the existing byte reads.
//!
//! `for byte in view` keeps the Copy-scalar `for` paths exactly: one
//! `byte_len` snapshot at `.value.s0`, an ordinary `usize` counter at `.s1`,
//! and the bounded loop at `.s2`. Each item is one *receiver*: the existing
//! `byte_get` result matched once, whose only arm is `Some`. The counter is
//! below the snapshot of an immutable, frozen view, so `None` is inconsistent;
//! it selects no arm and reaches every backend's existing exhaustive-match
//! invariant refusal. No byte is forged, defaulted, skipped or loaded
//! unchecked, and no buffer or view is materialized. This spelling carries no
//! authority: `hir::validation::byte_traversal` replays it independently.
//!
//! The shared paths construct the snapshot and receiver in place; no Vec
//! carrier is built and discarded. Raw AST has no source type, so the
//! receiver is outside the workspace `for` prebound: its two further
//! expression identities debit their own carriers as every `ExpressionId`
//! does, and [`receiver_backing`] debits every other byte it retains on the
//! active builder ledger before anything is constructed.

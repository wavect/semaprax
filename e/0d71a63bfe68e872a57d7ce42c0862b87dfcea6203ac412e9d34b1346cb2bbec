//! Independent replay of immutable borrowed `Slice<u8>` traversal.
//!
//! The resolver spelling has no authority. Every fact of the lowering is
//! checked again from ordinary HIR: one `byte_len` snapshot, a zero seed, a
//! strictly ascending unit counter, one receiver over the same view, the
//! `BorrowBytes` latch when the loop has lexical exits, and a body that cannot
//! rebind the view, snapshot, counter, item or receiver payload. The receiver
//! is the existing `byte_get` result matched once with only `Some`; an
//! inconsistent `None` selects no arm and reaches each backend's existing
//! exhaustive-match invariant refusal. It is the only partial match HIR
//! admits, and only as the item read of one such complete region.
//!
//! The view's owner stays frozen for the whole region by two independent
//! proofs, neither of which reads the view's own liveness: the census below
//! refuses any assignment of the view's authenticated provenance root inside
//! the body, and loan planning starts an ordinary `TraversalFreeze` loan on
//! that root before the region and ends it only after the region, so a move
//! or transfer of an owned root anywhere in the traversal overlaps it.
